# Admin-Dashboard

Project "Admin Dashboard" is one of the projects in The Odin Project, Intermediate HTML and CSS Course.
You can find more about the Assigment [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard).

- I closely followed the provided layout and structure, utilizing Flexbox and Grid.
- The result is a clean and organized admin dashboard interface.
- I interpreted the design concept and added my own visual style.

### Future Improvements

The current version of the project is not yet responsive, but I plan to add media queries and make it fully responsive in the future.
